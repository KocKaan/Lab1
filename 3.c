//Write a C main() program
//int main(int argc, char *argv[]) This program has two optional command
//line argument, “-d” (indicating duplicate) and “-u” (indicating uppercase).
//As we did in class these may be combined in several ways (search for “pink and
//yellow” in the lecture notes). Your program reads characters with getchar()
//and, for each character read (call it C), the program prints corresponding
//character(s) using putchar().

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
  
}
